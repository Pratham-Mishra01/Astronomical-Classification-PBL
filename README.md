Astronomical Object Classification Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
This project aims to automate the classification of astronomical objects—specifically stars, galaxies, and quasars—using machine learning techniques. Leveraging labeled data from large sky surveys, the project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and result visualization in a Jupyter notebook environment.
