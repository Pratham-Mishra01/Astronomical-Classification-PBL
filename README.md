# Stellar-Classification-PBL
<br>
Astronomical Object Classification Using Machine Learning <br>
<u><b>Project Overview</b></u><br>
This project aims to automate the classification of astronomical objects—specifically stars, galaxies, and quasars—using machine learning techniques. Leveraging labeled data from large sky surveys, the project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and result visualization in a Jupyter notebook environment.<br>
