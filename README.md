# Astronomical Object Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to automate the classification of astronomical objects—specifically stars, galaxies, and quasars—using machine learning techniques. Leveraging labeled data from large sky surveys, the project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from raw data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and result visualization in a Jupyter notebook environment.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans, scales, and encodes features for optimal model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements and compares multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).
- **Evaluation:** Uses metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices to assess model performance.
- **Visualization:** Plots training and validation curves, as well as key results for model interpretation.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of astronomical survey data with features such as right ascension, declination, photometric magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z), redshift, and class labels.

- **new stellar dataset.csv** Contains the original features from the astronomical survey.
- **new_stellar_dataset_scaled:** the features are scaled using StandardScalar

## Results

Achieved high classification accuracy with multiple machine learning models. Training and validation curves indicate strong model generalization and robust learning. Key features influencing classification include photometric bands and redshift.
